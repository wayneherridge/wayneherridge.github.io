    <p>Occupying an exceptionally handsome estate in the southern English countryside, the London England Temple is located about 25 miles south of London, just a few miles east of the London Gatwick Airport. Several buildings share the site—most notably a three-story, 40-room Elizabethan-style mansion—known as the Manor House, which has served various purposes for the Church over the years including patron housing and missionary training center. Surrounding the temple are 10 acres of paradise-like formal grounds featuring Eden Brook on the southern border of the property and numerous stately oak trees including the plaque-bearing "David O. McKay Oak." A picturesque pond sits to the southwest creating inspiring reflections of the temple both day and night.</p>

    <h2>Why These Temples?</h2>

    <div class="news">
    <p>Was there ever a man who, in a time of quiet introspection, has not pondered the solemn mysteries of life? Has he not asked himself: “where did I come from? Why am I here? Where am I going? What is my relationship to my Maker? Will death rob me of the treasured associations of life? What of my wife and children? Will there be another existence after this, and, if so, will we know one another there?”</p>
      <br>
    <p>The answers to these questions are not found in the wisdom of men. They are found only in the revealed word of God. Temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are sacred structures in which these and other eternal questions are answered. Each is dedicated as a house of the Lord, a place of holiness and peace, shut apart from the world, where truths are taught and ordinances are performed that bring knowledge of things eternal and motivate the participant to live with understanding of his divine inheritance as a child of God and an awareness of his potential as an eternal being.</p>
      <br>
    <p>The stately new temple, recently completed on the outskirts of Washington, D.C., is the 16th such structure operated by the Church. These buildings, different from the thousands of regular Church houses of worship scattered over the earth, are unique in purpose and function from all other religious edifices. It is not the size of these buildings, or their architectural beauty, that make them so. It is the work that goes on within their walls.</p>
      <br>
    <p>In addition to the Washington Temple, other Latter-day Saint temples are found in the western area of the United States and in Hawaii, Canada, New Zealand, England, and Switzerland. Two such structures were built in the early years of the Church but were abandoned when the Latter-day Saints were driven from place to place under the cruel bigotry of a less tolerant age.</p>
